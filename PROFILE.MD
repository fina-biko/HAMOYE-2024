Welcome to my GitHub profile
step 1
creating a new branch
created  a branch different from the main branch
this new branch contains creation of file profile.md that is not created in the main branch
if i want to put this file to be in the main branch too, I just need to merge these 2 branches

step 2 
compare and pull requests
Compare: The "compare" feature in GitHub allows you to view the differences between two branches or commits in a Git repository. You can use it to compare the changes made in one branch or commit with another branch or commit. This is particularly useful for understanding what code changes have been made between different versions of your project.

so pull requests is a way  of telling github that the main branch or the master  etc should pull the  code in this side branch  and  then merge these branches so that they now be at pur.
Here's how the process works:

Creation of a Feature Branch: The developer creates a new branch from the main branch to work on a specific feature or fix. This feature branch contains the changes that the developer intends to eventually merge into the main branch.
Development and Committing Changes: The developer makes changes to the codebase within their feature branch, committing changes as they progress.
Pushing the Feature Branch: Once the changes are ready for review, the developer pushes the feature branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
Opening a Pull Request: The developer then opens a pull request on GitHub, specifying the feature branch as the source branch and the main branch as the target branch. This indicates that they want to merge the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.
Review and Discussion: Other team members can review the code changes, leave comments, suggest modifications, and discuss the proposed changes within the pull request.
Merge: If the changes are approved and deemed ready, a team member with appropriate permissions can merge the pull request, integrating the changes from the feature branch into the main branch then the feature branch can be deleted.
